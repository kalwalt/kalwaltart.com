# ARnft and JsartookitNFT are part of WebAR Kit

I decided to transfer the ownership of my two projects **ARnft** and **JsartoolkitNFT** to the github organization **[WebAR Kit](https://github.com/webarkit)**, you can visit the website [www.webarkit.org](https://www.webarkit.org), because i believe in this project. I have written about **jsartoolkitNFT** in a previuos article: [JsartoolkitNFT: simplified version of jsartoolkit5 for NFT](https://www.kalwaltart.com/blog/2020/04/14/jsartoolkitnft-light-jsartoolkit5-for-nft/). Initially ARnft was developed as part of jsartoolkitNFT, but i realized that was better to separate the two.
