I recently started managing my personal page on **Patreon**. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) is a platform that let a creator share his work and get support by patrons, supporters which give direct monetary aid at different levels based on own availability. Visual artists, Illustrators, video makers, singers, musicians are some categories present on **Patreon**.
